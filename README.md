🚀 AtliQ Hospitality Dashboard Insights 🏨📊

I'm excited to share my Latest Power BI Project, where I analyzed key hospitality metrics to track revenue, occupancy, average ratings and booking trends. Also used advanced DAX, drilldown, Tooltip and Conditional formatting to make the Dashboard more Insightful. 

Key takeaways:
✅ Revenue: $1.7bn with a significant impact from booking platforms.
✅ Occupancy Rate: 57.87%, showing a positive WoW growth.
✅ Top City: Mumbai leads in reliability and revenue generation.
✅ Booking Trends: Weekends drive higher revenue, but occupancy rates fluctuate.
✅ Room Class Insights: Premium rooms have higher RevPAR, but cancellations remain a challenge
